# Python Project 15: Excel Report Generator 📊🧠  

## 📌 Problem Statement:  
Build a script that reads raw data and automatically generates a formatted Excel report — ideal for automating monthly sales, inventory, or analytics reports.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn:  
- Using pandas and openpyxl  
- Data processing and Excel writing  
- Auto-formatting and report automation

## ✅ Python Code:  
 ```
import pandas as pd

Read raw data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

Perform summary (example: total sales by region)
summary = df.groupby('Region')['Sales'].sum().reset_index()

Write to Excel
with pd.ExcelWriter('sales_report.xlsx', engine='openpyxl') as writer:
    df.to_excel(writer, index=False, sheet_name='Raw Data')
    summary.to_excel(writer, index=False, sheet_name='Summary')
```

## 📤 What It Does:  
1. Loads raw CSV data  
2. Summarizes key metrics  
3. Writes multiple sheets into one Excel file

## 🛠️ Requirements:  
bash
pip install pandas openpyxl


## 🔧 Try Modifying:  
- Apply conditional formatting  
- Add charts using xlsxwriter  
- Automate with a scheduler (e.g., weekly report)

## 💡 Use Cases:  
✅ Monthly sales summaries  
✅ Automated client reports  
✅ Inventory or financial tracking
